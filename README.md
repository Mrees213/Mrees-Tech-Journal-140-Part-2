# Mrees-Tech-Journal-140-Part-2

First Lab
Lab 1.1

In the Lav, we test the connectivity of our virtual machines.

The tracert command is handy when mapping my pings along with nslookup, which maps out the number of IP addresses within a domain, provided I did that part correctly.

If we ignore the licensing issues for the sake of not taking a cheap shot, the primary problem I encounter is connectivity. When the virtual machine was turned on, it could not connect to any network, which made it to complete the lab. IT took half of trying various solutions, including creating a dial-up connection and a Network from scratch before I realized that if I turned off the bridge and used a NAT connection, I could connect to the network. Which it did, allowing me to complete it without minimum difficulty.
